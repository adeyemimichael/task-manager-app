# EComm

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

 THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNT IN THIS ANGULAR COURSE IS 
SETTING UP OF AN ANGULAR app: and angular is a component oriented framework of react and we can use it for production ready apps. when i want to start an angular project i will run the command ~ng create @angular/latest name-of-file 
if i want to create a component in a folder in an angular project i will first open the integrated terminal on the folder and after that i will run ~ ng generate component file-name 

to run it i will use the command ng serve

    I HAVE ALSO LEARNT THE FOLLOWING 
    creating a variable 
    adding bootstrap and tailwind to angular 
    interpolation : which is a processs whereby i can render the variavbles that is written in the component.ts to the html component
    data binding property binding  : this is a way of linking a variable with an element by makein use of value or type 

    two way binding 
this is used mainly in forms and it make use of the ngModel to link data from the component ts to the html and it can change real time data input. so this can work when a user want to submit a form and you want the name to show in real time as they are typing it.
event binding is when we use function to bind with html
